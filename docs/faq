**Are these articles plagiarism?**
Both the AI generated articles, as well as the human edited version pass multiple plagiarism tests before being delivered to you 
and are no different than someone summarizing a news story with multiple sources, 
this falls under something called "observational journalism", more commonly knowns as rewriting.

**Will Google punish my website if I use these articles?**
The human written articles are no different than any other human written article found online. 
Our AI articles are indistinguishable from human written articles to a search engine. They can pass machine learning models trained to detect AI written texts, 
and can occasionally score better than actual human written articles as shown by this paper from the University of Brighton.

Edit Mode
========

If you own an article, you can also edit its generated content. By clicking on the **More** dropdown menu and choosing *Edit* you will enter a drafting edit mode, where you can change the following:

- Choosing a different photo from a list of relevant photos
- The Headline
- The Article Text

Any changes you make will be stored and used for teaching Monok to write more articles the way you want them to be.

Setup Automatic Daily Feed
========

Setting up an article generation news feed is done by using the profile page of your monok account.

1. Go to your profile page and add a new feed.
2. Insert the keywords for your query and any relevant location, if any
3. Choose additional settings such as interlinking or social media embeds 

Example of a UK Entertainment News Feed
---------------------------------

.. image:: images/setupgaming.png

In this example we've set up an article generation feed for news about gaming consoles. We've chosen 2 articles every Weekday (Mon-Fri). We've also chosen a 600 word human editing service, so articles are automatically passed through a human editor that expands and edits the articles. When the edits are finished and submitted, the article is automatically sent as a draft or published to the target website url.

Our Query is the following ::

    nintendo, xbox, playstation


We've also gone ahead and chosen interlinking so articles have links for previously published articles, as well as social media embeds for embeded tweets and youtube videos as well as the photos options that provides us with multiple photos for each article.

Example of a UK Entertainment Feed

In this example, we're generating news from a restricted geographical area (United Kingdom). We've also chosen to go with just AI Generated drafts, where no human is involved. We're also sharing the feed with a friend of ours.

Our Query is the following ::

    celebrties, entertainment, gossip
